# Stocks Simplified
Stocks Simplified is a beta version an app idea, with the intentions of displaying graph data from live stock prices in a more readable fashion for average consumers who do not have a background in the financial market. Currently, the app is not meant to be used for actual financial gains, however, data is real time and called from TwelveData API. Beyond that, the goal of the app is learn and apply these new technologies to turn my goals into a reality while improving my coding abilities:

- React Native
- TypeScript
- WebSockets
- Redux/React-Redux


## What I have learned from new technologies
### a) React Native
- Basic differences between React and React Native (e.g. Native components and styling versus divs, etc.)
- App screen navigation through React Native navigators => also how to have nested navigators
- Gesture handlers 
- integrating built-in types of React Native for typescript 
- metro bundler and xCode simulator

### b) TypeScript 
- types and interfaces for variables/functions/components/classes
- type-checked function value entry and return values


### c) WebSockets 
- difference between server and client websockets
- integrating websocket to an API
- using websockets for parsing real-time data through channel subscriptions

### d) Redux/React-Redux
- File structure and fundamentals of Redux
- connecting redux to components via mapStateToProps to have state accessible within components, as well as dispatching actions
- type-checking my initial state, payloads and actions for typescript
